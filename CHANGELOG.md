# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Check-in: `NoteModal` replaces `window.prompt` for adding attendee notes — textarea with 2000-char limit and live counter, Cancel/Add note buttons, ESC support, touch-friendly
- Settings → Sessions panel: superadmin can list all active staff sessions with role, device, IP, and last-seen; revoke individual sessions or bulk-revoke all operator sessions scoped to an event
- Settings → Security panel: configure admin/operator session TTL, remember-device duration (`0` = disabled), and which roles require MFA; env-locked settings shown as read-only with badge
- `GET /api/admin/sessions`, `POST /api/admin/sessions/:id/revoke`, `POST /api/admin/events/:eventId/revoke-all-operator-sessions`, `GET /api/admin/system-settings`, `PATCH /api/admin/system-settings` API endpoints (superadmin)
- Session revoke and bulk-revoke actions write to `AdminAuditLog`

### Fixed
- Check-in card now shows a coloured left border per scan status (green = valid, red = revoked/invalid, yellow = already checked in, blue = preview) — previously all cards looked identical regardless of result
- Login page title and heading changed from "Operator sign in" to "Sign in to Admitto" — admins and operators share the same login screen
- Sidebar no longer marks the Overview section as live; it shows "Soon" until Overview is built (v1.0)

### Security
- `trusted_device_days = 0` now fully disables remember-device: existing trusted-device cookies are rejected immediately at `validateTrustedDevice()` call time, not only after natural row expiry; new cookies and `createTrustedDevice` calls are also blocked

## [0.4.4] - 2026-06-19

### Security
- Bump transitive `undici` 6.26.0 → 6.27.0; addresses CVE-2026-12151 (high), CVE-2026-9679 (moderate), CVE-2026-11525 and CVE-2026-6733 (low) (#94)

### Fixed
- Container publish workflow: `workflow_dispatch` on branch refs runs scan-only (Trivy SARIF, CRITICAL gate) without SBOM path or Docker metadata failures (#93)
- GHCR push, provenance attestation, and release SBOM restricted to `refs/tags/v*.*.*` semver refs; semver-shaped branch names can no longer trigger a publish

## [0.4.3] - 2026-06-19

### Added
- Attendee list export to CSV, XLSX, and PDF with check-off column and formula-injection sanitization (#88)
- Dynamic custom attributes in admin drawer: edit fields driven by `EventItem.config.contents` instead of hardcoded `shirt_size` (ADR 0030, #91)
- Export columns follow `EventItem.config.contents` definitions; check-in parity preserved
- `SECURITY-CONTROLS.md`: configurable security capabilities table with TOTP and OIDC implementation detail
- `CORPORATE-DEPLOYMENT.md`: self-hosted model, customer-hosted stack, no SaaS
- `ARCHITECTURE-FOR-AUDITORS.md`: scope, generic exposure overview, roadmap flows
- `GDPR-ONE-PAGER.md`, `SUBPROCESSORS.md`: purposes, retention, subprocessor template, DSAR options
- `DSAR-PROCEDURE.md`: organizer-mediated access and erasure template (Option B)
- `INCIDENT-RESPONSE.md`: rotation, rollback, severity template; GDPR Art. 33/34 72-hour breach notification
- Zod validation on `custom_data_fields` keys; stable export column order (`orderBy: key`)
- Duplicate Excel headers disambiguated as `Label (source_field)`; PDF column widths scale down when many attributes exceed printable width
- Export integration tests use isolated events

### Changed
- `DATA-PROTECTION.md` updated with legal basis note (LIA for legitimate interest)

### Fixed
- Drawer degrades gracefully when event-items API fails

### Security
- Removed `|| true` from Semgrep CI step — SAST findings now block pull requests (baseline verified at 0 findings before merge)

## [0.4.2] - 2026-06-19

### Added
- Admin attendee table with pagination, search, status and ticket-type filters, and badge parity with operator UI
- Edit drawer: change guest fields in-place, view communication history, resend ticket email
- CSV and XLSX import: canonical column headers, row preview and validation errors, overwrite toggle, agency UUID/QR payload support
- Event-day configuration: event items (gift bag, badge, headset), `ops_config` toggles, content fields linked to attendee data
- Admin mail UI: edit MJML/HTML templates, preview with sample data, send a test message
- Delivery log: browsable per event (status, retries; no rendered HTML in list views)
- `GET /readyz` token-protected readiness check for database, Redis, and migration status (ADR 0026)
- Pre-migration database backup on container start when pending migrations exist (ADR 0027)
- CI guard against destructive migration SQL; rollback runbook; smoke test for backup path
- Trivy image scan and CycloneDX SBOM in CI; `SECURITY.md` updated
- Export also matches selected fields inside `custom_data` JSON

### Changed
- Backend routes are event-scoped (wrong event returns 403) with CSRF on mutating calls
- Migrations apply automatically on container start (fail-fast); no manual `migrate deploy` for operators
- Requires Node ≥ 22.13 for exceljs ↔ uuid interop (`require(esm)`)

### Fixed
- Concurrent edits: second save on the same guest returns a clear stale-write response instead of silently overwriting (ADR 0028)
- Request body limits and safe error messages on mail endpoints; export-only dev sink for local mail testing (ADR 0029)
- Transitive `uuid` forced to 14.0.0 (#13); patch bumps for vitest, eslint, argon2

### Database migrations
- `20260618120000_event_item_contents` — metadata for configurable event-item content
- `20260618140000_attendee_updated_at` — `updated_at` on attendees for optimistic locking

## [0.4.1] - 2026-06-17

### Added
- Attendee card after scan or manual lookup: guest name, company, ticket type, check-in status, warnings, item rows, recent notes, audit context; stacks on narrow screens (< 1024 px)
- Item fulfilment at the door: gift bag (shirt size shown on row), badge (auto-issue on check-in when configured), headset (issue and return)
- Every item and check-in change logged in `AttendeeActionLog` (who, session, device, IP)
- Manual lookup by name or email: PII in request body (not URL); also matches `company` and `department` inside `custom_data`
- Scan history sidebar with admitted count; operator notes (max 2 000 characters, author + timestamp)
- Per-tablet undo of last check-in: rolls back admission and auto-issued badge; requires device label at login
- Opt-in camera QR decode via dynamically loaded `@zxing/browser`; USB keyboard wedge remains primary scan path

### Changed
- Manual lookup uses the same admit path as scan — no double admission on repeat tap (CAS)
- Undo hidden when session has no device label (matches server 409 response)

### Database migrations
- `20260617120000_event_day_ops` — `custom_data`, `ops_config`, event items, item states, notes, action log
- `20260617130000_attendee_note_body_check` — DB CHECK on note body length

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-17

### Added
- `@admitto/ui` design system: tokens, status badges, 13 React primitives, theme vars with anti-lockout branding fallback
- Admin and operator shells served from the same origin as the API; role-based redirect to correct surface after login
- Auth-aware heartbeat (`ConnectionStateProvider`) so tablets know when the server session is alive
- Staff SPA at `/admin`, `/operator`; public ticket page `/t` reskinned to match
- Scanner-first check-in entry: autofocus buffer, Enter to submit, refocus after each scan, ~300 ms duplicate debounce
- Scan result card with status badge; shared check-in route for admin and operator URLs
- Self-hosted Tabler Icons and Inter font — no runtime dependency on jsDelivr or Google Fonts (ADR 0012)
- Defense-in-depth headers on staff SPA shell (CSP, `nosniff`, `no-referrer`, `frame-ancestors 'none'`) (ADR 0017)

### Changed
- Semantic theme tokens replace hardcoded hex in `components.css` and `ticket.css`
- `Tabs` reconciles `active` when the `tabs` prop changes after mount

### Fixed
- Controlled redirects when post-login path resolution fails (no HTTP 500 on auth edge cases)

## [0.3.7] - 2026-06-16

### Added
- `scripts/release-tag.sh` for signed annotated tags (`git tag -s`) with pre-push checks
- `VERSIONING.md` with SSH/GPG signing setup and release steps including GitHub Release
- Re-signed tags `v0.3.3`–`v0.3.6` on GitHub (verified: true); future tags use the script

## [0.3.6] - 2026-06-16

### Added
- Multi-stage production Docker image for `apps/web`; migrations run on container start
- `deploy/docker-compose.yml`: app + Postgres + Redis + nginx (loopback `:8080`; app internal `:3000`)
- `GET /healthz` with database ping for Docker health checks
- CI `docker-build` job; `publish-container` pushes `ghcr.io/solarssk/admitto:0.x.y` and rolling `:0.x` on each semver tag (ADR 0018)
- Optional `deploy-smoke` `workflow_dispatch`

## [0.3.5] - 2026-06-15

### Added
- Cloudflare Access JWT validation on `/admin*` and `/api/admin*`; missing JWT redirects to `/login`, not 401 (ADR 0017)
- Per-request CF identity resolution via `ExternalIdentity` seam — no long-lived Admitto session for CF logins
- Superadmin UI to configure team domain, audience, JWKS test; env locks override DB as kill switch
- Group-to-role mapping synced on each valid CF JWT; boot fail-fast when CF Access enabled without team domain/AUD
- `CF_ACCESS_ENABLED=false` env override as emergency kill switch

### Database migrations
- `20260615200000_cf_access_settings` — system settings defaults for CF Access keys

## [0.3.4] - 2026-06-15

### Added
- OIDC login (Authentik-first): Authorization Code + PKCE; full ID token validation (JWKS, issuer, audience, nonce)
- JIT provisioning: new OIDC users get zero roles unless a configured group-to-role rule matches (fail-closed)
- Account linking: explicit `?link=1` step-up (password + TOTP when required); `link_step_up_at` on OAuth state (5 min TTL)
- `OidcRoleGrant` tracks OIDC-provisioned roles; demotion revokes grants without touching manual `RoleAssignment` rows
- Superadmin UI for OIDC provider config; client secrets encrypted at rest; SSRF guards on discovery URLs
- `resolveOrCreateUserFromExternalIdentity` shared seam for Cloudflare Access

### Changed
- SMTP adapter requires TLS 1.2+ (`minVersion: "TLSv1.2"`)
- Check-in history `limit` clamped to 1–100 at HTTP and domain layers

### Fixed
- Duplicate `RoleAssignment` rows removed; partial unique indexes on scoped and instance roles
- OIDC provider save resolves HTTP endpoints before DB transaction (no network I/O inside transactions)
- Idempotent grant creation under concurrent OIDC logins (`P2002` → safe no-op)
- `prisma migrate deploy` on `admitto_auth_test` before auth integration tests in CI

### Database migrations
- `20260615120000_oidc_linking` — `IdentityProvider`, `ExternalIdentity`, OAuth state tables
- `20260615140000_oidc_hardening` — schema and index hardening
- `20260615160000_oidc_scope_normalization` — scope normalization for group-to-role mappings
- `20260615170000_oidc_link_step_up` — `link_step_up_at` on OAuth state
- `20260615180000_oidc_role_grants` — `OidcRoleGrant` + group mapping tables
- `20260615190000_role_assignment_unique` — dedup, partial unique indexes, grant repoint, FK cascade

## [0.3.3] - 2026-06-14

### Added
- TOTP 2FA for admin and superadmin roles; operators unchanged (full session after password, no MFA friction on event day)
- Partial session stages: `mfa_pending` and `enrollment_required` gate privileged routes until TOTP completes
- Backup recovery codes (argon2id-hashed, one-time use)
- Optional trusted-device cookie (hash-only in DB); skips TOTP on known browsers; revoked on logout, MFA reset, and session revoke
- Break-glass CLI: `reset-mfa`, `generate-emergency-recovery` (superadmin@instance only, audit log)
- `SystemSettings`: session TTL, operator session TTL, trusted device days, `mfa_required_roles` (env lock → DB → default)

### Security
- CSRF origin check honours `X-Forwarded-Proto` and `X-Forwarded-Host` only when `TRUST_PROXY=true` (aligned with rate-limit client-IP policy)
- TOTP replay protection: `last_totp_time_step` + otplib `afterTimeStep`; conditional DB update guards parallel replay

### Changed
- Dependency updates: `hono` 4.12.25, `@hono/node-server` 2.0.4, `redis` 6.0.0, `zod` 4.4.3, `@typescript-eslint/parser` 8.61.0, CodeQL action SHA bump
- `RedisRateLimitStore` adapted for redis v6 (`withAbortSignal()`, two-arg `eval()`)

### Database migrations
- `20260614130000_2fa_totp` — `Session.stage`, `UserMfaMethod`, `TrustedDevice`, `SystemSettings` seed; active elevated sessions re-staged
- `20260614210000_totp_replay_protection` — `UserMfaMethod.last_totp_time_step`

## [0.3.2] - 2026-06-14

### Added
- Server-rendered operator auth: `GET/POST /login`, `GET /operator`, `POST /logout`
- Session cookie (`httpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`); optional device label; CSRF on login/logout and `POST /api/checkin/scan`
- Login rate limits: IP-based and per-email on failed attempts
- `Attendee.public_ref` (unique, non-guessable) for agency ticket URLs
- Public routes `/t/:slug/a/:ref` and `/q/:slug/a/:ref.png` resolve by `public_ref`, not internal `Attendee.id`
- Backfill on deploy: agency attendees without `public_ref` receive one automatically
- `scripts/test-web-like-ci.sh` for local CI parity; test contract in `apps/web/test/README.md`

### Changed
- Default `ALLOW_CHECKIN_BEARER=false`; session + event scope required for scan and history; Bearer token is break-glass only
- Per-operator scan/history rate limits applied after authentication (not shared with unauthenticated IP quota)
- Integration tests stabilized: Vitest unit (no Postgres) vs integration (one `globalSetup` with `migrate deploy`); integration files under `test/integration/`

### Fixed
- CI failures from shared `admitto_web_test` DB (`P3005`, Prisma segfault on repeated `force-reset`): fixture cleanup instead of per-file DB resets

## [0.3.1] - 2026-06-14

### Added
- Local `User` accounts with argon2id password hashing and `is_active` state
- Break-glass superadmin bootstrap CLI: `npm run auth:bootstrap` (password from stdin, not argv)
- `@admitto/auth` package: login, logout, session validation, password verification, auth audit logging, capability-aware authorization helpers
- HTTP auth endpoints: `POST /api/auth/login`, `POST /api/auth/logout`, `GET /api/auth/me`
- Event-scoped check-in RBAC: `superadmin@instance` (all events), `admin@organization` (org events), `operator@event` (assigned event only)
- DB-backed `Session` records: opaque high-entropy tokens (only `token_hash` stored), expiry, single-session revoke, event-scoped bulk revoke
- Role-sensitive session lifetimes: shorter for operators, longer for admin and superadmin

### Changed
- `/api/checkin/*` extended to accept a valid session or the transitional legacy Bearer token; ADR 0003 deploy policy preserved

### Security
- Uniform unauthorized responses for bad email and bad password to reduce user enumeration risk
- Dummy verification path for missing users; structured login audit logs without password or session token leakage
- Login rate limiting; `httpOnly` session cookie with `SameSite=Lax` and `Secure` outside development

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-13

### Added
- Provider-level test-send: one message per event without triggering bulk delivery
- Read-only mail config inspection with masked secrets
- Delivery log listing without exposing full rendered HTML bodies
- Redis-backed shared rate limiting on public `/t/*` and `/q/*` routes; in-memory fallback when Redis is not configured

### Changed
- Rate limiting fails open when Redis is configured but unavailable — ticket access prioritized over strict limiting during an outage

## [0.2.4] - 2026-06-11

### Fixed
- Defensive DB `CHECK` constraints on `RoleAssignment`
- Crypto key-version behavior hardened
- Seed fails predictably when encryption is misconfigured

## [0.2.3] - 2026-06-11

### Added
- `Organization` as the tenant boundary; `organization_id` threaded through the event and delivery model
- Role and scope groundwork: `superadmin`, `admin`, `operator`
- Attendee ticket tokens encrypted at rest via `@admitto/crypto` (AES-256-GCM, ADR 0006)

## [0.2.2] - 2026-06-11

### Added
- Docker Compose for local development with PostgreSQL
- CI service wiring for real database path
- Relational constraints preventing cross-event check-in mistakes at the DB layer

### Changed
- Standardized on PostgreSQL as the single database engine across development, CI, and production (ADR 0004)

## [0.2.1] - 2026-06-11

### Added
- Atomic single-use check-in: one QR/token cannot admit twice (CAS, ADR 0001)
- Recent check-in history endpoint
- Temporary operator Bearer gate on `/api/checkin/*`

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-08

### Added
- CSV/XLSX attendee import with agency UUID preservation
- Internal QR/token issuance; agency UUID/external payload support
- Public ticket page (`/t/:slug`) and hosted QR image routes (`/q/:slug`)
- Split between internally generated token-based tickets and agency-provided identifiers

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-08

### Added
- Monorepo setup with initial DB schema and package boundaries
- CI pipeline and basic security baseline (CodeQL, Semgrep, gitleaks, npm audit, Dependabot)
- Mail adapter groundwork
- Gate 0 outcome recorded: Power Automate as MVP mail path; Graph/SMTP remain future re-validation candidates
